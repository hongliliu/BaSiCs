    """Finds blobs in the given grayscale image.

    Blobs are found using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) method [1]_.
    For each blob found, the method returns its coordinates and the standard
    deviation of the Gaussian kernel that detected the blob.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Input grayscale image, blobs are assumed to be light on dark
        background (white on black).
    min_sigma : float, optional
        The minimum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this low to
        detect smaller blobs.
    max_sigma : float, optional
        The maximum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this high to
        detect larger blobs.
    num_sigma : int, optional
        The number of intermediate values of standard deviations to consider
        between `min_sigma` and `max_sigma`.
    threshold : float, optional.
        The absolute lower bound for scale space maxima. Local maxima smaller
        than thresh are ignored. Reduce this to detect blobs with less
        intensities.
    overlap : float, optional
        A value between 0 and 1. If the area of two blobs overlaps by a
        fraction greater than `threshold`, the smaller blob is eliminated.
    log_scale : bool, optional
        If set intermediate values of standard deviations are interpolated
        using a logarithmic scale to the base `10`. If not, linear
        interpolation is used.

    Returns
    -------
    A : (n, 3) ndarray
        A 2d array with each row representing 3 values, ``(y,x,sigma)``
        where ``(y,x)`` are coordinates of the blob and ``sigma`` is the
        standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel which detected the blob.
