    Blobs are found using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) method [1]_.
    For each blob found, the method returns its coordinates and the standard
    deviation of the Gaussian kernel that detected the blob.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Input grayscale image, blobs are assumed to be light on dark
        background (white on black).
    sigma_list : np.ndarray, optional
        Provide the list of sigmas to use.
    scale_choice : str, optional
        'log', 'linear' or 'ratio'. Determines how the scales are calculated
        based on the given number, minimum, maximum, or ratio.
    min_sigma : float, optional
        The minimum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this low to
        detect smaller blobs.
    max_sigma : float, optional
        The maximum standard deviation for Gaussian Kernel. Keep this high to
        detect larger blobs.
    num_sigma : int, optional
        The number of intermediate values of standard deviations to consider
        between `min_sigma` and `max_sigma`.
    threshold : float, optional.
        The absolute lower bound for scale space maxima. Local maxima smaller
        than thresh are ignored. Reduce this to detect blobs with less
        intensities.
    overlap : float, optional
        A value between 0 and 1. If the area of two blobs overlaps by a
        fraction greater than `threshold`, the smaller blob is eliminated.
    weighting : np.ndarray, optional
        Used to weight certain scales differently when selecting local maxima
        in the transform space. For example when searching for regions near
        the beam size, the transform can be down-weighted to avoid spurious
        detections. Must have the same number of elements as the scales.
    merge_overlap_dist : float, optional
        Controls the minimum overlap regions must have to be merged together.
        Defaults to one sigma separation, where sigma is one of the scales
        used in the transform.

    Returns
    -------
    A : (n, 5) ndarray
        A 2d array with each row representing 5 values,
        ``(y, x, semi-major sigma, semi-minor sigma, pa)``
        where ``(y,x)`` are coordinates of the blob, ``semi-major sigma`` and
        ``semi-minor sigma`` are the standard deviations of the elliptical blob,
        and ``pa`` is its position angle.
